Tarball file contains:
	lab_B_tcp.c - This file is the source code where it obtains the host name, port # and
		      server status URL for the TCP logging server, sends temperature and
		      date to the server, and reads and performs commands received from
		      server. The executable file created by this file requires 
		      [--host=HostName], [--log=LogFile] and [--id=9DigitNumber] options.
		     
	lab_B_tls.c - This file is the source code where it obtains the host name, port # and
		      server status URL for the TLS logging server. This does the same thing
		      as lab4c_tcp.c except it communicates through TLS connection.

	Makefile    - This is the Makefile for the Lab 4C. It builds executable files
		      (lab4c_tls and lab4c_tcp), makes tarball file that includes files
		      listed in this README, and cleans out all the output files created
		      by Makefile.

	README      - This contains information on files contained in the tarball file.
		      It also contains helpful websites that were used for the project.
