This tarball file contains
	lab4b.c : This is the source code for this project. It allows reading and outputting
		the temperature and current time, accepts command from STDIN which can 
		modify the program options. 
		The beginning of the program accepts the following options
			1. --period=number : it speficfies the time interval
			2. --scale={F|C}   : it sets temperature to either Celsius or
					     Fahrenheit format
			3. --log=filename  : it enables logging to the specified filename
		
	
	Makefile: builds and tests the application. It includes:
		default: builds the program with -Wall and -Wextra
		check  : executes an automated smoke-test of the application to see
			 if it runs and can talk to its sensors/actuators
		clean  : deletes all programs and output generated by the Makefile
		dist   : creats the delverable tarball
	 

	README  : contains the descriptions of each of the included files
		  and any other comments on this project.

NOTES:
*** My sensor did not work, so I must find a way to get sensors to work. This is possibly
manufacture fault since I've tried all their suggest ways to check whether they work or not.
The sample codes they gave me did not recognize the sensor as well even though all the plugs
are properly plugged in to the device.


I checked the other part of the code by first disabling the initializing sensor and reading
the temperature. Afterwards, I gave a random temperature to check whether the remaining part
of the code works as the specification.
